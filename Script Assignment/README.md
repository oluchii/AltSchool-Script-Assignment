This repository contains two basic Bash scripts created as part of an assignment. 
The scripts help perform useful command-line checks related to files and directories.

`check_file.sh`
This script verifies whether a specified file exists. It takes the file name or path as an argument and returns a message indicating whether the file is found.

`count_files.sh`
This script calculates the total number of files within a given directory. It takes the absolute path of the directory as an argument and returns the count of all files inside it.
